# Advent of Code 2021

My solutions to [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021/).

Built with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) targeting `es2021`.

To run my solutions you need [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed and preferrably [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) for package management and script-running.

First run `yarn` to install dependencies, then you can run the solutions with the build script:

`yarn build day1/day1-part1.ts`

`yarn build day1/day1-part2.ts`

`yarn build day2/day2-part1.ts`

Etc, etc...

For development you can run the same solution with the dev script and it will reload on changes in the file:

`yarn dev day1/day1-part1.ts`
